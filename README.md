# Robust Bayesian Inference for Simulator-based models via the MMD Posterior Bootstrap
This repository contains all code needed to recreate the results in the paper "Robust Bayesian Inference for Simulator-based models via the MMD Posterior Bootstrap" by 
Charita Dellaporta, Jeremias Knoblauch, Theodoros Damoulas and Fran√ßois-Xavier Briol. The code for the MMD posterior bootstrap is written in Python. Our method uses [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html) which is 
compatible with GPU usage, hence we provide both the files needed to run experiments locally and an .ipynb file compatible for use with Google Colaboratory. 
We use the R code provided by Bernton, Jacob, Gerbert & Robert (2019) [here](https://github.com/pierrejacob/winference/tree/master/inst/reproduceabc) to compare against ABC with the Wasserstein 
distance. More detailed README files can be found inside the `src` subfolder.

## Requirements 
- Python == 3.7.*
- Numpy == 1.19.5
- Jax == 0.2.13
- SciPy == 1.4.1
- Seaborn == 0.11.2

## Reproducing experiments 
- The folders `data`, `results` and `plots` contain all the datasets used for the experiments and the relevant samples and plots obtained. All scripts will require you to 
set the relevant paths to such folders when reproducing the experiments. 
- To reproduce the experiments for the NPL based methods (i.e. NPL-MMD, NPL-WAS and NPL-WLL) locally, run `run_gaussian.py`, `run_gandk.py` and `run_togswitch.py` by setting the relevant data/results/plots paths 
directly after imports and indicating whether you want to generate new datasets or use the ones used in the paper (located in `data` folder). 
The files will run, save and plot the results to the relevant paths. Alternatively, the notebook `Experiments_notebook.ipynb` is optimised for use with [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
The notebook mounts your google drive and calls all the relevant py scripts so you need to import the `src` folder in your google drive. 
- To run the experiments for the same datasets using the Wasserstein-ABC method run the `run_wabc_experiments.R` file which is entirely based on the code provided
by the authors in Bernton et al. (2019).
