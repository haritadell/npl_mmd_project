### Data generated for the 10 independent runs of the experiments 
- For the Gaussian and G-and-k models the experiments are reapeted for 10 runs and for 0,5 and 10% of outliers present in the dataset, so for example file `run_i_outl_j.txt` corresponds to the ith run (with i from 0 to 9)
for percentage of outliers: j = 0 corresponding to 0%, j = 1 corresponding to 5% and j = 2 corresponding to 10%. 
- For the Toggle Switch model there are 10 sets of data, one for each run (`run_i.txt`).
